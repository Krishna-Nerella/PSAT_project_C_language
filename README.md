This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in the C programming language. The project consists of two separate C programs: one for user vs. user gameplay and the other for user vs. computer gameplay.

## User vs. User Gameplay

### How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C compiler (such as GCC) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.
3. Navigate to the `user_vs_user` directory.
4. Compile the C code by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   gcc tic_tac_toe_user_vs_user.c -o tic_tac_toe_user_vs_user
Run the compiled executable:

For Linux/Mac:

bash

./tic_tac_toe_user_vs_user
For Windows:

bash

tic_tac_toe_user_vs_user.exe
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the Tic Tac Toe game with another user.

User vs. Computer Gameplay
How to Run
Make sure you have a C compiler (such as GCC) installed on your system.

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.

Navigate to the user_vs_computer directory.

Compile the C code by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
Copy code
gcc tic_tac_toe_user_vs_computer.c -o tic_tac_toe_user_vs_computer
Run the compiled executable:

For Linux/Mac:

bash
Copy code
./tic_tac_toe_user_vs_computer
For Windows:

bash
Copy code
tic_tac_toe_user_vs_computer.exe
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the Tic Tac Toe game against the computer. You will be playing as "X" and the computer will be playing as "O".

Rules of the Game
Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns to place their symbol ("X" or "O") in an empty cell. The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all the cells are filled and no player has three symbols in a row, the game ends in a draw.

Example Board:


  1 | 2 | 3
  ---------
  4 | 5 | 6
  ---------
  7 | 8 | 9
  
How to Play
1. Players take turns to choose an empty cell to place their symbol.
2. Enter the number corresponding to the cell where you want to place your symbol.
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled, and no player has three symbols in a row, the game ends in a draw.
