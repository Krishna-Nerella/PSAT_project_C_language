This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in the C programming language. The project consists of two separate C programs: one for user vs. user gameplay and the other for user vs. computer gameplay.

## User vs. User Gameplay

### How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C compiler (such as GCC) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.
3. Navigate to the `user_vs_user` directory.
4. Compile the C code by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   gcc tic_tac_toe_user_vs_user.c -o tic_tac_toe_user_vs_user
